# Deep LSTM and GRU Networks for Stock Market Prediction
## Overview

The project aimed to explore and implement advanced RNN networks, including GRU and LSTM, using Keras and Python programming language. The dataset used for this project was the Iranian stock exchange dataset, which aimed to predict the market's direction for the next day. The first step in the project was to load and preprocess the dataset. Then, GRU and LSTM architectures were implemented and trained separately to obtain the highest possible accuracy rates. The accuracy of each architecture was compared to determine which architecture performed better on the given dataset. Also, Various model hyperparameters such as the count of LSTM or GRU cells were investigated and compared. In the final step, the stacked deep networks of the mentioned architectures were investigated and implemented to achieve higher accuracy rates and explore the results.

The project aimed to exploit the GRU and LSTM networks' unique properties, such as the ability to handle long-term dependencies and sequential data, to improve the accuracy of market prediction. Additionally, the project aimed to compare the performance of these two advanced RNN architectures on the given dataset and determine which architecture is best suited for the task.

The results of the project could be useful for stock traders and investors who want to make informed decisions based on market trends and predictions. Furthermore, the project could inspire further research into the implementation and optimization of advanced RNN architectures for financial forecasting and prediction.

This project was completed as part of the "Neural Networks" (changed to "Neural Computing and Deep Learning") course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran, taught by Professor Reza Safabakhsh(<safa@aut.ac.ir>). I took this course during my Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering at AUT in Spring 2022.
